                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science and Machine Learning at California State University, Los Angeles, and I’m on track to graduate in December 2024. 
                        I have a deep passion for developing robust machine learning models that solve real-world problems, particularly in the areas of predictive modeling, data-driven decision-making, and optimization techniques.
                        I’ve successfully completed two major projects in machine learning, which have sharpened my expertise in algorithm design, feature engineering, and model evaluation.</p>

                        <p>Prior to this, I worked as an Application Development Analyst at Accenture for nearly 3 years, where I gained significant experience in full-stack development, system optimization, and scalable architecture. 
                        I engineered end-to-end, data-driven transaction systems for Societe Generale using JavaScript, MySQL, and RESTful APIs, ensuring high-performance and seamless integration across services. 
                        I also applied Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, leveraging SQL Developer and complex stored procedures to optimize database queries and enhance processing efficiency.</p>
                        
                        <p>My role involved close collaboration with front-end developers and the DevOps team to streamline CI/CD pipelines using Java, Spring Boot, and Jenkins, which enhanced the deployment of high-availability applications. 
                        I am highly motivated to apply advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble learning, deep neural networks, and reinforcement learning to tackle complex industry challenges.</p>
                        
                        <p>With a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning, I am eager to contribute to impactful machine learning projects that drive innovation and efficiency. 
                        My ultimate goal is to leverage these technologies to deliver data-driven solutions that create value for businesses and society alike.</p>
